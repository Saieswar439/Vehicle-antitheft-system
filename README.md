## CONCLUSION  

The Fingerprint-Based Vehicle Anti-Theft System with SMS and Live Tracking was designed to enhance vehicle security by everaging biometric authentication, GSM based remote control, and GPS tracking, tailored specifically for two-wheelers. The project was driven by the need to address the limitations of traditional security systemsâ€”such as mechanical locks and basic alarmsâ€”which are easily bypassed by modern theft techniques like key duplication and hot-wiring. By integrating fingerprint recognition, SMS communication, and location tracking, the system aimed to provide a multi-layered defense against theft, empowering owners with real time oversight and response capabilities. The project successfully met most of its objectives, including biometric authentication, SMS control, user feedback, ignition control, and cost-effectiveness (total cost ~$50â€“60). However, the failure to integrate real-time GPS tracking and the systemâ€™s dependency on network connectivity highlight areas for improvement. The prototype serves as a proof-ofconcept, demonstrating the potential of low-cost, smart security systems for two-wheelers, while its modular design and open-source platform (Arduino) make it a valuable educational tool for students and researchers in embedded systems and IoT.
